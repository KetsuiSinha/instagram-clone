# Instagram Clone - A Sleek and Simple Social Media Experience

Welcome to the **Instagram Clone**, a project that captures the core elements of Instagram in a beautifully simple and fully functional web application. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this clone simulates the fundamental features of Instagram, such as browsing photos, liking posts, and viewing user profiles—all with a responsive, mobile-first design.

## Features

This Instagram clone offers the following core features, designed to provide a polished and interactive experience:

- **Photo Feed**: Browse through a stunning, grid-based photo feed where users can scroll through posts just like they would on Instagram. The feed layout is designed to mimic Instagram’s aesthetic, with visually appealing images neatly arranged.

- **Profile Page**: Each user’s profile page shows their profile picture, bio, and a grid of images they've posted. This page gives users a look into the life of a fictional user, simulating a real Instagram profile experience.

- **Like Button**: Every photo on the feed has a "like" button, represented by an interactive heart icon. Clicking the heart adds a playful animation and changes the heart color, mimicking the "liking" behavior in Instagram’s interface.

- **Responsive Design**: The clone adjusts beautifully across devices, whether you're viewing it on your desktop, tablet, or smartphone. Thanks to a mobile-first design and media queries, the layout adapts smoothly to various screen sizes and resolutions.

- **Interactive Animations**: Smooth animations make the app feel responsive and fun. The "like" button, in particular, has a subtle heart animation that triggers when clicked, enhancing the user experience.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: The basic structure and content of the app.
- **CSS3**: Styling the Instagram clone with modern techniques like Flexbox, Grid, and transitions for smooth interactions.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactive functionality, such as toggling the "like" button and managing UI animations.
- **Media Queries**: Ensures that the app is fully responsive, looking great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
